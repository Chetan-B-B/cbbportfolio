# protfolio Site

1. When deploying using github pages the images were not loading (Except the socials icons which is still a mystery why they worked) but with the other images I had issue So I used import trick resolve it . for changes refere the same comit changes which I did for this Readme.md file . Happy coding :)
2. If you make any changes in the code just run `npm run deploy` -> This will deploy to the `gh-pages branch`all the things are configured already.
